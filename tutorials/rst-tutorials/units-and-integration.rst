Summary
-------

In this tutorial, we will use the examples of the Planck function and
the stellar initial mass function (IMF) to illustrate how to integrate
numerically, using the trapezoidal approximation and Gaussian
quadrature. We will also explore making a custom class, an instance of
which is callable in the same way as a function. In addition, we will
encounter ``astropy``'s built-in units, and get a first taste of how to
convert between them. Finally, we will use :math:`\LaTeX` to make our
figure axis labels easy to read.

The Planck function
-------------------

The Planck function describes how a black-body radiates energy. We will
explore how to find bolometric luminosity using the Planck function in
both frequency and wavelength space.

Let's say we have a black-body at 5000 Kelvin. We can find out the total
intensity (bolometric) from this object, by integrating the Planck
function. The simplest way to do this is by approximating the integral
using the trapezoid rule. Let's do this first using the frequency
definition of the Planck function.

We will define a photon frequency grid, and evaluate the Planck function
at those frequencies. Those will be used to numerically integrate using
the trapezoidal rule. By multiplying a ``numpy`` array by an ``astropy``
unit, we get a ``Quantity``, which is effectively a combination of one
or more numbers and a unit.

**Note on printing units**:

Quantities and units can be printed to strings using the `Format String
Syntax <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax>`__.
This demonstration uses the ``latex_inline`` format that is built in to
the ``astropy.units`` package. To see additional ways to format
quantities, see the `Getting
Started <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/#getting-started>`__
section of the astropy.units documentation pages.

.. code:: python

    nu = np.linspace(1., 3000., 1000) * u.THz
    bb5000K_nu = blackbody_nu(in_x=nu, temperature=5000. * u.Kelvin)
    plt.plot(nu, bb5000K_nu)
    plt.xlabel(r'$\nu$, [{0:latex_inline}]'.format(nu.unit))
    plt.ylabel(r'$I_{\nu}$, ' + '[{0:latex_inline}]'.format(bb5000K_nu.unit))
    plt.title('Planck function in frequency')
    plt.show()

Using :math:`LaTeX` for axis labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, we've used :math:`LaTeX` markup to add nice-looking axis labels.
To do that, we enclose :math:`LaTeX` markup text in dollar signs, within
a string ``r'\$ ... \$'``. The ``r`` before the open-quote denotes that
the string is "raw," and backslashes are treated literally. This is the
suggested format for axis label text that includes markup.

.. code:: python

    np.trapz(x=nu, y=bb5000K_nu).to('erg s-1 cm-2 sr-1')


:outputnumrole:`Out[3]:`




.. math::

    1.1280834 \times 10^{10} \; \mathrm{\frac{erg}{s\,sr\,cm^{2}}}



Now we can do something similar, but for a wavelength grid. We want to
integrate over an equivalent wavelength range to the frequency range we
did earlier. We can transform the maximum frequency into the
corresponding (minimum) wavelength by using the ``.to()`` method, with
the addition of an *equivalency*.

.. code:: python

    lam = np.linspace(nu.max().to(u.AA, equivalencies=u.spectral()),
                      nu.min().to(u.AA, equivalencies=u.spectral()), 1000)
    bb5000K_lam = blackbody_lambda(in_x=lam, temperature=5000. * u.Kelvin)
    plt.plot(lam, bb5000K_lam)
    plt.xlim([1.0e3, 5.0e4])
    plt.xlabel(r'$\lambda$, [{0:latex_inline}]'.format(lam.unit))
    plt.ylabel(r'$I_{\lambda}$, ' + '[{0:latex_inline}]'.format(bb5000K_lam.unit))
    plt.title('Planck function in wavelength')
    plt.show()

Notice this is within a couple percent of the answer we got in frequency
space, despite our bad sampling at small wavelengths!

Many ``astropy`` functions use units and quantities directly. As you
gain confidence working with them, consider incorporating them into your
regular workflow. Read more
`here <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/>`__ about how to use
units.

How to simulate actual observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of Fall 2017, ``astropy`` does not explicitly support constructing
synthetic observations of models like blackbody curves. The
```synphot`` <https://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ library does
allow this. You can use ``synphot`` to perform tasks like turning
spectra into visual magnitudes by convolving with a filter curve.

The stellar initial mass function (IMF)
---------------------------------------

The stellar initial mass function tells us how many of each mass of
stars are formed. In particular, low-mass stars are much more abundant
than high-mass stars are. Let's explore more of the functionality of
``astropy`` using this concept.

People generally think of the IMF as a power-law probability density
function. In other words, if you count the stars that have been born
recently from a cloud of gas, their distribution of masses will follow
the IMF. Let's write a little class to help us keep track of that...


:inputnumrole:`In[6]:`


.. code:: python

    class PowerLawPDF(object):
        def __init__(self, gamma, B=1.):
            self.gamma = gamma
            self.B = B
        def __call__(self, x):
            return x**self.gamma / self.B

The ``__call__`` method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By defining the method ``__call__``, we are telling the Python
interpreter that an instance of the class can be called like a function.
When called, an instance of this class, takes a single argument, ``x``,
but it uses other attributes of the instance, like ``gamma`` and ``B``.

More about classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Classes are more advanced data structures, which can help you keep track
of functionality within your code that all works together. You can learn
more about classes in `this
tutorial <https://www.codecademy.com/ja/courses/learn-python/lessons/introduction-to-classes/exercises/why-use-classes>`__.

Integrating using Gaussian quadrature
-------------------------------------

In this section, we'll explore a method of numerical integration that
does not require having your sampling grid set-up already.
```scipy.integrate.quad`` <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.1/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html>`__
takes a function and both a lower & upper bound, and our ``PowerLawPDF``
class takes care of this just fine.

Now we can use our new class to normalize our IMF given the mass bounds.
This amounts to normalizing a probability density function. We'll use
Gaussian quadrature (``quad``) to find the integral. ``quad`` returns
the numerical value of the integral and its uncertainty. We only care
about the numerical value, so we'll pack the uncertainty into ``_`` (a
placeholder variable). We immediately throw the integral into our IMF
object and use it for normalizing!

To read more about *generalized packing and unpacking* in Python, look
at the original proposal, `PEP
448 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/>`__, which was accepted
in 2015.


:inputnumrole:`In[7]:`


.. code:: python

    salpeter = PowerLawPDF(gamma=-2.35)
    salpeter.B, _ = integrate.quad(salpeter, a=0.01, b=100.)
    
    m_grid = np.logspace(-2., 2., 100)
    plt.loglog(m_grid, salpeter(m_grid))
    plt.xlabel(r'Stellar mass [$M_{\odot}$]')
    plt.ylabel('Probability density')
    plt.show()

How many more M stars are there than O stars?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's compare the number of M dwarf stars (mass less than 60% solar)
created by the IMF, to the number of O stars (mass more than 15 times
solar).


:inputnumrole:`In[8]:`


.. code:: python

    n_m, _ = integrate.quad(salpeter, a=.01, b=.6)
    n_o, _ = integrate.quad(salpeter, a=15., b=100.)
    print(n_m / n_o)


:outputnumrole:`Out[8]:`


.. parsed-literal::

    20936.017868337385


There are almost 21000 as many low-mass stars born as there are
high-mass stars!

Where is all the mass?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's compute the relative total masses for all O stars and all M
stars born. To do this, weight the Salpeter IMF by mass (i.e., add an
extra factor of mass to the integral). To do this, we define a new
function that takes the old power-law IMF as one of its arguments. Since
this argument is unchanged throughout the integral, it is passed into
the tuple ``args`` within ``quad``. It's important that there is only
*one* argument that changes over the integral, and that it is the
*first* argument that the function being integrated accepts.

Mathematically, the integral for the M stars is

.. math::  m^M = \int_{.01 \, M_{\odot}}^{.6 \, M_{\odot}} m \, {\rm IMF}(m) \, dm 

and it amounts to weighting the probability density function (the IMF)
by mass. More generally, you find the value of some property
:math:`\rho` that depends on :math:`m` by calculating

.. math::  \rho(m)^M = \int_{.01 \, M_{\odot}}^{.6 \, M_{\odot}} \rho(m) \, {\rm IMF}(m) \, dm 


:inputnumrole:`In[9]:`


.. code:: python

    def IMF_m(m, imf):
        return imf(m) * m
    
    m_m, _ = integrate.quad(IMF_m, a=.01, b=.6, args=(salpeter, ))
    m_o, _ = integrate.quad(IMF_m, a=15., b=100., args=(salpeter, ))
    
    m_m / m_o


:outputnumrole:`Out[9]:`




.. parsed-literal::

    20.29197629920483



So about 20 times as much mass is tied up in M stars as in O stars.

Extras
~~~~~~

-  Now compare the total luminosity from all O stars to total luminosity
   from all M stars. This requires a mass-luminosity relation, like this
   one:

.. math::


    \frac{L}{L_{\odot}} (M) =
     \begin{cases} 
         \hfill .23 \left( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right)^{2.3} \hfill , \hfill & .1 < \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} < .43 \\
         \hfill \left( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right)^{4} \hfill , \hfill & .43 < \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} < 2 \\
         \hfill 1.5 \left( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right)^{3.5} \hfill , \hfill & 2 < \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} < 20 \\
         \hfill 3200 \left( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right) \hfill , \hfill & 20 < \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} < 100 \\
     \end{cases},

which you will use as :math:`\rho(m)`

-  Think about which stars are producing most of the light, and which
   stars have most of the mass. How might this result in difficulty
   inferring stellar masses from the light they produce? If you're
   interested in learning more, see `this review
   article <https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept14/Courteau/Courteau_contents.html>`__.

Challenge problems
------------------

-  Right now, we aren't worried about the bounds of the power law, but
   the IMF should drop off to zero probability at masses below .01 solar
   masses and above 100 solar masses. Modify ``PowerLawPDF`` in a way
   that allows both ``float`` and ``numpy.ndarray`` inputs.
-  Modify the ``PowerLawPDF`` class to explicitly use ``astropy``'s
   ``units`` constructs.
-  Derive a relationship between recent star-formation rate and
   :math:`H\alpha` luminosity. In other words, for the function $
   {:raw-latex:`\rm SFR \, [\frac{M_{\odot}}{yr}]`} = C ,
   L\_{H:raw-latex:`\alpha`} , [{:raw-latex:`\rm \frac{erg}{s}`}]$, find
   a value of :math:`C`. How does this depend on the slope and endpoints
   of the IMF?
-  take a look at Appendix B of `Hunter & Elmegreen 2004, AJ, 128,
   2170 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:astro-ph/0408229>`__
-  what effect does changing the power-law index or upper mass limit of
   the IMF have on the value of :math:`C`?
-  predict the effect on the value of :math:`C` of using a different
   form of the IMF, like Kroupa or Chabrier (both are lighter on the
   low-mass end). If you're not tired of IMFs yet, try defining a new
   class that implements a broken-power-law (Kroupa) or log-parabola
   (Chabrier) IMF. Perform the same calculations as above.
